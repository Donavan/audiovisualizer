## Problem Description

There's an issue with the FFmpeg filter chain generation in the AudioVisualizer package that causes the following error when trying to process videos:

```
[AVFilterGraph @ 0x561c727d1ec0] No such filter: ''
Error initializing complex filters.
Invalid argument
```

The root causes are:

1. Improper labeling in the filter chain - both effects try to create a `[main]` label from `[0:v]` but don't actually use it correctly
2. Multiple output labels with the same name `[out]` - FFmpeg requires unique labels for each filter output
3. There's no proper chaining of filters, which FFmpeg requires for multiple effects

## Solution

Fixe these issues by:

1. Properly initializing the input video as `[main]` with a format filter
2. Making each effect's output label unique
3. Ensuring the final output is properly labeled as `[out]`
4. Adding proper handling for filter chain connections

The new filter generation approach must ensure that:

- Each filter has properly labeled inputs and outputs
- There's a single linear chain of filters
- The final output is properly labeled as `[out]`
